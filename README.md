# Survey-Task-Bloomtech-advanced-assignment

Overview
This is a timed programming challenge modeled after an actual engineering problem we
tackle at Blueberry Pediatrics - surveying a parent who has a sick child about their child’s
symptoms.
The problem
Imagine this scene: A parent who uses Blueberry Pediatrics has a child with a cough, and
they have just opened up the Blueberry website and indicated in it that their child has a
cough. The Blueberry website is now going to survey the parent for details about their
child's symptoms, drawing from a bank of questions. The intelligent survey system asks
different questions based on the parent's responses to prior questions, adapting the
survey to the child’s symptoms.
In this version of the survey, all questions are Yes/No questions.
Your task
Complete the webpage which asks the user a series of questions about the symptoms that
their child is experiencing. The survey webpage has only been partially completed, and you
need to finish it. Open up challenge.html, read its contents and complete it. Your answer
should be a very basic webpage using Javascript and HTML which:
  - Displays questions in the correct order, one question at a time.
  - Takes Yes/No responses, stores the responses somehow, and adapts the survey
based on those responses.
  - Displays some kind of completion message when a parent has finished the survey.
 
If there are any cases of ambiguity in how to implement something, please use your own
best judgement, and feel free to add code comments describing your decision.
Implementation
-  Your implementation should be as general as possible.
-  Your code should be clean, use reasonable variable and function names, and be
commented where appropriate.
-  Your implementation should work regardless of the number of questions in the
ALL_QUESTIONS object. Future engineers should be able to add values to ALL_QUESTIONS
following the same format as the existing questions in there, and it should work naturally.
